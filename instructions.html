  <h1>Instructions for Using the Title V State Access to Care Assessment Tool
  </h1>

  <h2>1. Registration</h2>

  <p>To fill out and submit the survey, you need to have a username (a valid
  email address that will be used to contact you) and password. All the members
  of each group that will be filling out the survey together&#8212;for example,
  everyone on the Minnesota team will work together to fill out one survey;
  everyone on the Mississippi team will fill out another survey
  together&#8212;will share an email address and password. Note: while everyone
  on your team can all fill out and submit the same survey, only <strong>one
  person at a time</strong> can safely edit the survey. If two or more people
  are editing the same survey at the same time on different machines, someone's
  entries are likely to be overwritten when someone else does a save, and one or
  more of you will lose your work. So make sure to take turns.</p>

  <p>To register, go to the login
  page&#8212;<a href="http://syssci.renci.org/SAT">http://syssci.renci.org/SAT/index.html</a>&#8212;and
  send an email to the address shown. In your email include your name and
  affiliation.</p>

  <h2>2. Logging in</h2>

  <p>The site adminstrator will register your team's email address and notify
  you of your password. Then you can log in: go to
  <a href="http://syssci.renci.org/SAT"> http://syssci.renci.org/SAT</a>,
  enter your email address and password into the appropriate spaces, and
  click the "Submit" button.</p>
  <p><span id="important-note">IMPORTANT</span>: Use
  <span class="good-span">Chrome</span> or
  <span class="good-span">Firefox</span> to log in to the State Assessment Tool.
  <span class="bad-span">Internet Explorer</span> and
  <span class="bad-span">Safari</span> may not work.</p>

  <h2>3. Home page</h2>

  <p>When you've logged in successfully you'll be looking at a page that shows 
  a link labeled "Log out," another link that says "Help with downloaded
  surveys," a list (initially empty) of all the surveys that have been saved by
  everyone on your team (that is, everyone who logs in to the SAT using the same
  email address and password that you use), and, at the bottom, a button labeled
  "Create New Survey."</p> 

  <h3>3.1. Log out</h3>

  <p>Click on this link to close the survey and return to the login page. For
  full security make sure you've logged out of all instances of the survey.</p>

  <h3>3.2. Help with downloaded surveys</h3>

  <p>This is a link to a <a href="spreadsheet-notes.html">page that
    explains the layout of downloaded files</a>.</p>

  <h3>3.3. The List of Saved Surveys</h3>

  <p>When you first log in to a new account this list will be empty. Each survey
  that you save will be added to this list. The list is ordered by date and time
  modified, most recent first.  There are four columns for each saved survey.
  </p>
 
  <h4 class="indented">3.3.1. Survey ID</h4>
 
  <p class="indented">The first column shows the numerical name assigned to each
  survey. The system assigns this name at the time a survey is saved. To open a
  saved survey, in order to look at it or edit it, click on its Survey ID.</p>

  <h4 class="indented">3.3.2. Name</h4>

  <p class="indented">The second column shows an optional name that you may have
  chosen to the survey in addition to the numerical name (in column 1
  automatically assigned by the software. See section 3.3.7 below to learn how
  to create this name.</p>

  <h4 class="indented">3.3.3. "Created At"</h4>

  <p class="indented"> The third column shows the date and time of creation for
  the survey in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). To get the local time find out how
  many hours difference there is between GMT and your own time zone, and
  subtract that difference. So, for instance, if your geographical location lies
  in the Eastern Time Zone and it's Daylight Saving Time, then the time where
  you are is four hours behind GMT, so subtract four hours from the "Created At"
  value to get your local time of creation.</p>

  <h4 class="indented">3.3.4. "Modified At"</h4>

  <p class="indented"> Column four shows the date and time (in GMT) a survey
  was most recently saved.</p>

  <h4 class="indented">3.3.5. "Download"</h4>

  <p class="indented">Click on "download" in the fifth column to download the
  survey for that row. The downloaded file can be imported into Excel or
  equivalent program in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format. See
  <a href="spreadsheet-notes.html">this page</a> for details of the file format.
  </p>

  <h4 class="indented">3.3.6. "Owner Email""</h4>

  <p class ="indented">This column displays the email address of the account
  used to create the survey described for that row.</p>

  <h4 class="indented">3.3.7. "Rename"</h4>

  <p class="indented">Click on "rename" in column seven to create or modify the
  name for that survey as displayed in column two.</p>

  <h4 class="indented">3.3.8. "Delete"</h4>

  <p class="indented">Click on the "X" in the eighth column for a survey you
  wish to remove entirely from the database. <span class="red">Warning!</span>
  Once it's deleted, it's gone forever, so be sure this is what you want to
  do.</p>

  <h3>3.4. Creating a New Survey</h3>

  <p>At the bottom of the home page there's a button that's labeled "Create new
  survey": click it to create a new blank survey.</p>

  <h2>4. Always Available in the Survey Footer</h2>

  <h3>4.1. The Save Button</h3>

  <p>Saves the survey you're filling out to the server database just as it is.
  It receives a number which you can use to retrieve it again later,
  to look at it or modify it.</p>

  <h3>4.2. Instructions</h3>

  <p>Opens (in a new tab or window) this Instructions page that you're looking
  at right now.</p>

  <h3>4.3. Navigation Tool</h3>

  <p>It looks like this:</p>
  
  <p class="indented">&#60;prev <span class="selected">Contents</span>
  Overview Instructions 0 1 2 3 4 5 Download next&#62;</p>

  <p>Use this to move around between the various sections of the survey. Click
  on "&#60;prev to move to the previous page (you won't go anywhere if you're
  on the first page&#8212;"Contents"&#8212;which is where you will be when you
  first open or create a survey). Click on "next&#62;" to move to the
  next page (if you're already on the last page&#8212;"Download"&#8212;you
  won't go anywhere). Click on anything in between those two and you'll go to
  the corresponding page. The page you're currently on is <span class="red">
  highlighted in red</span> in the Navigation Tool.</p>

  <h3>4.4. Single page</h3>
  
  <p>Click here to view the whole survey as a single unbroken page. You can 
  always go back to the multi-page format by clicking on the Navigation Tool.
  </p>

  <h3>4.5. Log out</h3>

  <p>This logs you out of the survey.</p>

  <h2>5. Printing as a PDF File</h2>

  <p>You should be able to print out the survey from any mainstream web browser.
  Each browser will have its own approach, but as a representative example: In
  Chrome 44 on the Mac (OS X 10.10.4), select “Print”, then “Open PDF in
  Preview" and then “Save.” There is a “Save as PDF” option for printing in
  Windows 8 Chrome version 39, and probably other versions as well.</p>

  <p> In other cases (e.g., Firefox and Internet Explorer on Windows), see
  <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2853698/how-to-save-a-webpage-as-a-pdf-or-mht-file.html" target="_blank">this article</a>
  which says “you’ll need a print-to-PDF program that interfaces with Windows
  as a print driver. There are plenty available, and you might have one
  installed that you don’t even know about.  In researching this article, I
  discovered that I have four. If you don’t have a PDF option among your print
  drivers, download and install the free version of the
  <a href="http://www.bullzip.com/products/pdf/info.php" target="_blank">
    BullZip PDF Printer</a>.”</p>

  <p>When you're printing, you may want to make sure you're in single page mode,
  so that the whole survey gets printed, rather than just the currently selected
  section.</p>

  <h2>6. Getting Back to the Home page</h2>

  <p>You can return to the home page from anywhere in the survey by clicking on
  the colorful National MCH Workforce Development Center logo in the left-hand
  corner at the top of each section.</p>

  <a name="importCSV"></a> 
  <h2>7. Importing a Downloaded Survey .csv File into Excel</h2>

  <p>The ".csv" extension on downloaded survey files stands for "Comma-Separated
  Values." Excel and other spreadsheet programs offer mechanisms for importing
  .csv files so that their contents are distributed across a number of separate
  cells in a spreadsheet for easier reading and manipulation. Simply opening a
  .csv file using the File Open dialog may work just fine, in which case the 
  rest of these instructions may be ignored. Sometimes, however, using "File
  Open" may cause the entire contents of a .csv file to be treated as a single
  unpartitioned block of text so that the whole thing is dropped into a single
  cell. In such an eventuality it will be visible but it probably won't be
  usefully formatted.</p>

  <p><em>Note that different versions of Excel and its ilk have different ways
    of reading in .csv files. These instructions describe the .csv import
    process for Excel version 14.5.9. They may not apply to your version or to
    other spreadsheet programs. If not, please consult the documentation that
    accompanies your software or search online.</em></p>

  <ul>
    <li>In Excel, select "New Workbook" from the "File" menu.</li>
    <li>Select "Import..." from the "File" menu.</li>
    <li>A dialog box titled "Import" will appear. Make sure the "CSV file" radio
    button is selected, and click the "Import" button.</li>

    <li>Using the standard dialog that appears (it's called "Choose a File" in
    this version), navigate to the folder on your hard drive that contains the
    .csv file you wish to import. For file type (the dropdown menu here is
    called "Enable:") choose "CSV Files." If that's not an option with your 
    spreadsheet program, or if the file you want to import is not visible in the
    dialog, try "All Files" or another file type. Double-click on the file
    you're interested in  or select it (single-click) and click on the "Get
    Data" button.</li>
    <li>The next dialog box that appears is titled "Text Import Wizard - Step 1
    of 3." Make sure the "Delimited" radio button is selected and that you're
    starting import at row 1. Click "Next."</li>
    <li>In the next dialog, titled ""Text Import Wizard - Step 2 of 3," make
    sure under "Delimiters" that <strong>only</strong> the "Comma" radio button
    is checked (in Excel 14.5.9 "Tab" always needs to be explicitly deselected).
    "Treat consecutive delimiters as one" should <strong>not</strong> be
    checked. Click "Finish."</li>
    <li>The next dialog is called "Import Data." It asks "Where do you want to 
    put the data?" Select the radio button labeled "Existing sheet:" and use
    the default position =$A$1 (the top left corner of the workbook). Click
    "OK."</li>
    <li>You'll probably need to set the formatting in cells B4 and B5 (to the 
    right of the cells that read "Created At" and "Modified At") to be Numbers
    of the Date category. Choose a Type that shows time in addition to day,
    month, and year.</li>
    <li>See <a href="spreadsheet-notes.html">Help with downloaded surveys</a>
    for more information on what's in the file you just imported. That same
    information is also available from a link with the same title on the 
    survey's <a href="home.html">home page</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
