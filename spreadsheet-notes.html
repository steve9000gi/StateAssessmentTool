      <h2>Help with downloaded surveys</h2>
      <p>When you download a survey, you should be able to load it into any spreadsheet software, including Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. Once you do, here are some notes about how the data is displayed.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The first 10 rows are metadata about the survey and have a substantially different format than the actual survey data. The general approach is that column A contains the field, and column B contains the value. The exceptions are rows 9 and 10, which contain the 5 names and 5 affiliations, respectively, in columns B-F.</li>
        <li>Rows 11-15 contain the followup text from the bottom of each section.</li>

        <li>Everything after row 16 is the survey data. The general format is:
          <ul>
            <li>Column A: section number (e.g. &quot;s1&quot;)</li>
            <li>Column B: question number (e.g. &quot;q1&quot; or &quot;q2b&quot;)</li>
            <li>Column C: question type (see below)</li>
            <li>Column D: text from &quot;list&quot; areas (e.g. Section 1, Question 5, where it says, &quot;If yes, please list specific partners:&quot;)</li>
            <li>Column E: text from &quot;notes&quot; areas</li>
            <li>Columns F-: depends on the question type</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Question types:
          <dl>
            <dt>selectOne</dt>
            <dd>Only one answer is possible. The selected answer is in Column F. The first answer is 1, the second answer is 2, etc. If no answer was selected, the value will be &quot;_&quot;. In a few cases (e.g. Section 2, Question 4), the survey allows text to be entered as an explanation for choosing an answer labeled &quot;other&quot;. In such cases, the &quot;other&quot; text is in Column G.</dd>

            <dt>selectMany</dt>
            <dd>Multiple answers are possible, as in, &quot;check all that apply&quot;. Columns F on contain a 1 if the corresponding answer was checked, and a 0 otherwise.</dd>

            <dt>selectOneThenSelectMany</dt>
            <dd>Some questions, like Section 5 Question 1a, are fundamentally a &quot;selectOne&quot; question, but there are additional checkboxes under one of the answers. As with the &quot;selectOne&quot; question type, Column F contains the primary answer and Column G contains any &quot;other&quot; text. The following columns contain the sub-answers as in the &quot;selectMany&quot; question type. Note that sub-answers are only possible if the first primary answer is selected, so all of the values after Column G will be 0 unless Column F is 1.</dd>

            <dt>CLOA</dt>
            <dd>This is a &quot;Capacity and Level of Activity&quot; question, like in Section 1, Question 7. Column F is the Capacity from 0-5, and Column G is the Level of Activity from 0-5, which may be blank if the user did not select a Level of Activity.</dd>
          </dl>
        </li>

        <li>
          The text from &quot;notes&quot; and &quot;list&quot; areas can contain multiple lines. If they do, the lines will show up in a single spreadsheet cell with <code>\n</code> separating them.
        </li>
      </ol>
