Here's what needs doing for the SAT project.

- backend
  - create an admin script to create new users
  - API route to download data as CSV/TSV

- infrastructure
  - should be able to pretty much just copy the stuff from SSM
  - use port 8081, which has been opened on syssci for this purpose

- frontend:
  - Home page
    - lists owned surveys, sorted by most recently modified time
    - if admin, also lists all other surveys
    - each contains a link to open the survey
      - link is guarded by a popup prompt warning against simultaneous editing
    - also contains a link to download the survey (as TSV)
    - also a button to create a new survey
  - Survey page
    - the survey ID should be present in the URL
    - fetch the form data from the backend (serialize data -> JSON)
    - submit the form data to the backend (deserialize data <- JSON)
