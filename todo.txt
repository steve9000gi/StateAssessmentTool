Here's what needs doing for the SAT project.

- backend
  - create an admin script to create new users
  - API route to download data as CSV/TSV

- infrastructure
  - should be able to pretty much just copy the stuff from SSM
  - use port 8081, which has been opened on syssci for this purpose

- frontend:
  - Home page
    - also contains a link to download the survey (as TSV)
  - Survey page
    - need logout link (probably in footer)
